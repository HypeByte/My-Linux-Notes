      <li><b>Memory:</b> Kernel keeps track of memory, what is allocated to a current process, what is shared, and what is free.</li>
      <li><b>Device Drivers:</b> Kernel acts as an interface between hardware and processes ~ Usually, Kernels job to operate hardware.</li>
      <li><b>System Calls:</b> Processes use them to communicate with Kernel.</li>
    </ul>
